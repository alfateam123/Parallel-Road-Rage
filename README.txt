(Parallel) Road Rage is a graph editor that lets user design a graph, declaring connections and length of these arcs.
This graph editor is not only a graph editor, but lets user solve combinatorial optimization problems, allowing constraints and asking solvers to retrieve solutions.
If needed, constraints and solvers can be written also by user, modifying the source code and rebuilding it.
